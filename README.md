# Learning-Python- 

There are three activities:
* Atividade_1
* Atividade3
* Trabalhofinal
consisted of the exercices I used to start learning Python. 

In "Atividade_1" I have an algoritm that allows the user to enter 2 numbers and choose and operation to perform with them. 
In the same script there is an algorithm gives you the final value to be payed in a hotel once you enter the amount of days you wish to stay and also the room choice. 

In "Atividade3" I used pandas to make descriptive analysis of a football player dataset. In this script there is data descriptions, consultations, and specific salary means. 

In "Trabalhofinal" I used a dataset available in the website 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alanjones2/dataviz/master/londonweather.csv', that contains climate data of London city. 
This script is mainly focus on creating graphs using 'matplotlib' to plot the changes in climate throughout the years.
